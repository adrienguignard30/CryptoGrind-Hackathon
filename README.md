CryptoGrind

A blockchain project management app built with React and WalletConnect.

Setup and Run





Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-grind.git



Go to the client folder (this is the React frontend):

cd crypto-grind/client



Install dependencies:

npm install



Note: This includes react-i18next for internationalization (i18n), which is already in the code.



Start the app:

npm start

The app will run on http://localhost:3002 (or another port if specified).

Usage





Connect your wallet via WalletConnect (e.g., MetaMask or Abstract Wallet).



Add, edit, or delete crypto projects.



Filter projects by type, date, or name.

Internationalization (i18n)

The app supports multiple languages using react-i18next. Translation files are in client/src/locales/. The setup is already in the code (client/src/i18n.js), so you don't need to install extra dependencies.

Requirements





Node.js (v18 or higher)



npm



A WalletConnect-compatible wallet
